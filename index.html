<h2 style="font-style: oblique;font-size: 30;color: white"> WHAT IS A HTML?</h2>   
<p style="font-style: italic;font-size: 18;color: azure"> Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. <br>It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.HTML tags are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how your web browser must format and display the content. Most tags must have two parts, an opening and a closing part. ... Note that the closing tag has the same text as the opening tag, but has an additional forward-slash ( / ) character.HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997</p>

   <p style="font-style: italic;color: azure;font-size: 18">3 .Web document Creation<br>
       Document creation on the internet is dominated by HTML and its basic concept via tag and DOM i.e. document object model. HTML tags are inserted before and afterward or phrases to locate their format and location on the page. A web document consists of three sections: title, head, and body. Head includes the information to identify the document, including title and any other important keyword. A title can be seen on the browser’s bar and the body section is the main portion of the website visible to the viewer. All three segments are designed and created by the uses of HTML tags. Every section has its own specific set of tags, which are dedicatedly rendered keeping the head, title and body concepts in a loop.</p>
